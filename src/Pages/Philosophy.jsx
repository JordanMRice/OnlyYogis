            <h2> The Aim of Yoga</h2>
            <p>The primary aim of yoga is to resotre the mind to simplicity and peace, and free it from confusion and distress. This sense of calm comes from the practice of yogic asanas and pranyama. Unlike other forms of exercise which strains muscles and bones, yoga gently rejuvenates, the body. By restoring the body, yoga frees the mind from the negative feelings cause by the fast pace of modern life.

            </p>

            <p> When there is perfect harmony between body and mind, we achieve self-realization. Yoga teaches us that the obstacles in the path of our self-realization show themselves in a physical or mental indisposition. When our physical state is not perfect it causes an imbalance in our mental state, which is known in Sanskrti as chittavritti. The practice of yoga helps us overcome that imbalance. </p>
